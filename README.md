# Soccer Stats

A CLI written in Rust to keep your soccer statistics âš½ðŸ“Š.

It features two commands:
- `add name goals assits`
- `del name`

The CLI shows a table of statistics that updates dynamically as you input commands. It uses a Finite State Machine to parse the commands and show auto-completion suggestions as you are typing.
